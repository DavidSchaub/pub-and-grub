# Lewis’s Meatloaf

## Ingredients

* 1 kg ground beef (2 ¼ lb) 85% lean or lower works best, if using 70% lean, add 100g more meat or 25g of bacon fat, lard, or tallow)
* 40 g of breadcrumbs (1 1/2 oz)
* Minced garlic, to taste
* Minced onion or dehydrated onion
* 20-30 mL of  Worcestershire sauce (4 or 5 teaspoons?)
* One egg
* Heavy dash or three of Montreal steak seasoning (optional)
* 4 drops of liquid smoke (optional)


## Instructions

1. In a large bowl combine all ingredients and mix well with a wooden spoon until the egg disappears into the meat (or skip the spoon and go to the next step)
2. With freshly washed hands mix the meat thoroughly with your fingers kneading it like a bread dough. If you have a stand mixer you can use that on slow speed instead, but the cleanup isn’t really worth the effort.
3. Form into a ball and throw the ball down into the bowl repeatedly to force all the air out, throwing it at least a half dozen times to get it as dense as possible. Do not re-knead or mix the meat at this point. If during baking the meatloaf cracks or splits apart (or worse falls apart), you need to be more vigorous with your throwing next time.
4. Form into desired loaf shape remembering that the loaf will shrink, so you do not want to make it too high. Put in a lightly greased pan in an oven at 180 ℃ (350 ℉?) for about 40 minutes, checking temperature with a good meat thermometer after 30 minutes. Do not over cook, get it to the safe temperature (about 70 ℃) and get it out.
5. Let the loaf rest for at least 10 minutes before cutting.

## Notes

* You can add a strip or two of bacon on top for added flavor, especially recommended if you have a low-fat ground beef (anything 85% lean or higher).

* It is traditional to add a stripe of ketchup or barbecue sauce to the top of the meatloaf, but this is neither necessary nor recommended.

* For gluten free, replace breadcrumbs with 60g ground oat meal.

* Makes a 900g meat loaf. The recipe works well doubled, but thrown in a third egg.
