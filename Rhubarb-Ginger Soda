Rhubarb-Ginger Soda
 
time 45 minutes
yield 1 gallon
 
ingredients
4 cups (about 2 pounds) chopped rhubarb
1 gallon water
Juice of one lemon
6 oz sugar
2 oz. ginger
 
directions
1. Put the rhubarb and water into a large pot set over high heat. Cover the pot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for about 20 minutes.
2. Pour the orange and lemon juices and honey into a 3-quart or larger container.
3. Pour the hot rhubarb through a strainer into the container, pressing on the rhubarb to release all the flavor. Discard the rhubarb.
4. Whisk to dissolve the honey in the warm liquid. Taste and add more honey if desired, keeping in mind that you will be diluting the base with seltzer.
5. Cool to room temperature and then force-carbonate or carbonate with yeast.
 
Notes:
If anyone wants to make this and would like to carbonate with yeast, drop me a line.
It can also be made into a syrup suitable for mixing with seltzer water by using 1/2 gallon water and leaving all other ingredients the same, then mixing half and half with seltzer.
