## Homemade Irish Cream üëçüèº

### SERVINGS: MAKES 3 3/4 CUPS OR 30 FLUID OUNCES TIME: 5 MINUTES

## Notes
* To add a faint coffee flavor: Mix 1 teaspoon instant espresso or coffee powder with the cocoa and then continue as written, whisking the cream slowly into it.
* To make less sweet: Add more cream and more whiskey, 1 tablespoon of each at a time.
* To make less boozy: Add more cream and condensed milk, 1 tablespoon of each at a time.
* To make more boozy: You‚Äôve got this.

## Ingredients

* 1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1 cup (235 ml) heavy whipping cream
* 1 (14-ounce or 415 ml) can condensed milk
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 cup (235 ml) Irish whiskey (I used Jameson)

## Instructions

1. In the bottom of a pitcher, whisk cocoa powder and a spoonful of cream into a creamed paste. Slowly, whisking the whole time, add more cream a spoonful at a time until the paste is smooth and loose enough that you can whisk the rest of the cream in larger splashes. This step is critical to get right, otherwise the chocolate (and coffe) will seperate out.

2. The point of this mixing it to keep the chocolate smooth and not separated.

3. Once all of the cream is in, whisk in condensed milk, whiskey and vanilla. Cover with lid or plastic wrap and keep in fridge for up to two weeks, possibly longer.

Serve in a tiny tumbler filled with ice, or splashed into coffee.

##### I make a large bach of this and bottle it up as gifts for the holidays (Festivus/Saturnalia/Bachanal/Etc)
