# The Perfect Tuna Melt

## Ingredients

* Tuna, 2 x 5oz cans, drained
* Onion, medium size, chopped
* Celery, Â½ a stalk, chopped
* Garlic (1 clove), minced (or, you know, six cloves ðŸ˜€)
* Parsley, 1 tablespoon, chopped
* Mayonnaise, 3-4 tablespoons
* Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 3 tablespoons, divided
* Mozzarella, â…“ cup, shredded
* Bread, sliced (good bread, or a Pita Pocket)
* Butter, softened (BUTTER)
* Salt and Pepper to taste

## Instructions

	1	Drain water from tuna and put the tuna into a medium bowl.
	2	Chop onion, celery, and parsley. Mince garlic and add ingredients to tuna.
	3	Add mayonnaise, olive oil, and mozzarella cheese. Combine all ingredients until well incorporated. Salt and pepper to taste.
	4	heat oil on high in a skillet, then add a slice of buttered bread (down)
	6	Scoop about 2 tablespoons of tuna salad on bread while it is browning.
	7	Add buttered bread slice on top (butter up).
	8	When browned, flip the tuna melt over and grill the other side.

## Alternate

* Skip the olive oil and the butter. Put a thick layer of mayonaise on the bread and put that in the hot skillet, mayo side down. Bread will toast to a perfect golden color, but will do it quickly. Do not put on too much mayo, put it on and mostly scrape it off and repeat with second slice.
