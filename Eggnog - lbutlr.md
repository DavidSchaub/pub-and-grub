# Eggnog (egg-nog)
## At least a week prep time
### Approximately 2 litres/quarts

## Ingredients
* 6 eggs
* ¼ tsp salt
* 150g (¾ cup) sugar
* 100g (½ cup) sugar
* 250g (1 cup) bourbon
* 125G (½ cup) rum
* 1 tbsp vanilla extract
* 450g (2 cups/1 pint) whipping cream

## Instructions
1. Separate room-temperature eggs.
1. Beat egg yolks with salt and 150g sugar until thick and pale yellow
1. Stir in bourbon, rum, and vanilla
1. Beat egg whites until foamy, then add 100g sugar while still beating until the eggs form stiff peaks.
1. Whip whipping cream until stiff
1. Gently mix the whites into the yolks. Do not beat.
1. Fold whipped cream into the egg mixture.
1. Pour into a glass jar and store in a cool space for at least a week (a half gallon milk jar is perfect) or double the recipe an use an apple cider jug. Do not refrigerate, store in a cupboard, under your stairs, in the basement, etc.
1. Once each day, gently shake the jar.
1. Shake the jar before serving in small cups sprinkled with ground nutmeg.

## Do not use a plastic jug unless you know it is rated for alcohol
### Depending on the eggs, you might have a little too much to fit into a half gallon jar. Recipe can be doubled with no other modifications.
### after a week the nog is ready to drink, but you can leave it for several more days and the taste will mellow.
### Use cheap alcohol. Good alcohol will be wasted and will end up not tasting as good.
