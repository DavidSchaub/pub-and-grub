# General Tso's Chicken

## Ingredients

* 2 egg whites* *
* 3 Tbsp dark soy sauce
* 3 Tbsp Chinese cooking wine
* 3 Tbsp vodka
* ¼ tsp baking soda
* 3 Tbsp cornstarch
* 1 ½ lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs

### Breading:

* 1 cup all purpose flour
* 1 cup cornstarch
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 3 Tbsp reserved marinade

### Sauce:

* 4 Tbsp dark soy sauce
* 4 Tbsp Chinese cooking wine
* 3 Tbsp rice wine vinegar
* 4 Tbsp chicken stock
* ¼ cup sugar
* 1 tsp roasted sesame seed oil
* 1 Tbsp cornstarch
* 6 scallions
* 4 cloves garlic
* 2 inch piece of ginger
* 6-12 arbol chiles (optional, not really)

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl beat the whites until frothy. Add soy sauce, chinese cooking wine, vodka. Beat together and set aside half for later use. In the same large bowl where half mixture remains, add baking soda and cornstarch, then whisk until smooth. Cut chicken into 1 inch pieces and add to mixture. Mix together by hand, making sure every piece is coated. Cover and set aside for about 20 minutes. 
2. Prepare breading: in a shallow dish, combine flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt. Pour in marinade and finger mix untilclumpy. Set aside.
3. Make sauce: In a small bowl put soy sauce, chinese cooking wine, rice wine vinegar, chicken stock, sugar, roasted sesame seed oil, and cornstarch. Whisk until completely smooth. Really smooth, any graininess of clumpiness will coat the chicken poorly.
4. Continue Sauce: thinly slice scallions (all whites and a couple inches of the green). Next grate garlic cloves and ginger. Sauté over medium high heat for one minute with 2 Tbsp hot vegetable oil and add garlic, ginger, and most the scallions (hold back only about 5-10%). Add arbol chiles (optional) and sauté for another minute. Add in sauce and sauté for one more minute until sauce has thickened.
5. Heat a quart of vegetable oil to 375°F. Coat chicken in the breading and add to frying oil one piece at a time and make sure not to crowd, cooking each batch for about 4 minutes. Place batches on wire rack that’s set on a rimmed sheet pan, and place in oven on low heat. Repeat until all chicken is fried. Keep the chicken warm until serving.
6. Add chicken to sauce mixture and coat over low heat. Serve with white rice (should be "overcooked" so it's a bit sticky) and garnish with held-back scallions.
