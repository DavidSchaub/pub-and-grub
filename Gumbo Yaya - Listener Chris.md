## INGREDIENTS

* 2 bell peppers (any color)
* 2 medium Spanish onions
* 4 celery stalks
* 5 cloves garlic
* 1 pack andouille sausage
* 1 lb chicken breast
* 1 dark beer, like Anchor Steam
* 1 cup vegetable, chicken, or beef stock (to start)
* 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter
* 1 cup AP flour
* Cajun spices (to taste) 
* Salt & pepper (to taste)
* File (to taste)

## DIRECTIONS:

Dice the bell peppers, onions, & celery and combine in a medium bowl (the "Trinity" or mirepoix). Mince the garlic and set aside separately. Cut the sausage into rounds and cut the chicken into stir fry-sized chunks. Toss the chicken in spices and set aside.

In the bottom of a dutch oven or other large soup pot, heat oil over medium high heat. Add sausage and cook until browned on each side, about five minutes total. Remove sausage and set aside. Add chicken to the still-hot oil and cook until browned on the outside. Add *half* the mirepoix and stir, cooking until onions are soft and translucent. Add the garlic and return the sausage to the pot. 

Deglaze the pot with the beer and cook until foam resides. Add stock to cover solid ingredients and reduce heat to a simmer. 

While the stew simmers, make a dark roux. Melt the butter in a clean nonstick pan over medium heat. Add the flour and stir until combined. Mixture will be the color of a light wood. Continue stirring, making sure to get the corners of the pan, as the foam subsides. The mixture will start to turn color, from khaki to "burnt umber" to coffee. When the mixture is the color of coffee with cream, milk chocolate, or an old boot (seriously), turn off the heat and add the remaining mirepoix to stop the roux from cooking. It should smell like a deep coffee. 

Scrape the roux/mirepoix mixture into the simmering stew and stir to combine. The gumbo will have a cloudy look to it as it cooks. Taste & adjust spices as necessary. The gumbo should be thickness of heavy cream--simmer uncovered if too thin, and add stock if too thick. Fat may separate to the top of the gumbo, and can be skimmed off or stirred back in. 

Serve over rice or straight with a dash of file in each bowl. Leftovers are excellent.
