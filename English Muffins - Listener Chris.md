# Listener Chris's English Muffins
**Prep time: 20 min**
**Rise time: 12-36 hours (starter & muffins)**
**Cook time: 10 min**
**Yields: 12 muffins**

## INGREDIENTS

### Starter:
* 3/4 cup flour
* 1/2 cup water
* 1/2 teaspoon instant or active dry yeast

### Muffins:
* 1 cup milk 
* 1 tsp instant or active dry yeast
* 2 tbsp granulated sugar
* 2 tbsp melted butter
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 1/2 cups white flour (to start)
* 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour (to start)


## DIRECTIONS:

### Starter:

In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, water, and yeast. Whisk the mixture
until it is smooth and glossy (~100 strokes). Cover and set aside at least 6
hours, but up to 24 (the longer, the more sour). If storing more than 24 hours,
refridgerate.


### Muffins:

In the bowl of a stand mixer (or large bowl), combine the milk and the yeast.

Add the starter and mix well with a spatula. Mixture will be frothy.

Add the sugar, melted butter, and salt. Combine.

Add the 3 cups of flour to the mixture and mix until a shaggy dough forms. 

Knead the dough with the mixer on medium speed for 5-8 minutes. Add extra flour
1 tbsp at a time as needed. Finished dough should be springy and slightly tacky,
but should not stick to your hand.

Transfer dough to a lightly oiled bowl and cover. Allow it to rise at least
overnight, and then move to refridgerator. It can remain there for up to 7 days.
Dough can be cooked all at once, or pieces as a time to cover multiple mornings.

When ready to cook, form discs about 2-2.5 inches across (slightly smaller than
a hockey puck) and slightly less than one inch thick. Let rest for at least ten
minutes, especially if coming out of the refridgerator. Sprinkle both sides
lightly with kosher salt and semolina flour or cornmeal, if you'd like.

Place the muffins in a skillet on very low heat and cover for 5-7 minutes, until
noticeably risen (this will decrease as the dough ages). Then turn to medium
heat and cook until browned and easily flippable, about 6 minutes. Flip and cook
the other side. The muffins should tap hollowly when ready.

Split with fork and serve.
